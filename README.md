-----------------------------------------------

ALX-SE Student project.
-----------------------

This is a portfolio project in completion of the foundation program of the ALX-SE program Cohort-15

Appointment management system (APPOMS) ia a booking system that helps reduce the stress
 of appointment overload on a service provider as well as ease the out-of-office horror
 experienced by clients when they want an in-person service.

appoms is accessible on the web on appoms.frace.tech

This project is born out of the need to eliminate the frustrating out-of-office challenges a client
every now and then.
Clients are at liberty to pick suitable time for their appointment based on the time slots available for
a service provider.

The technologies used include:

- The flask which is a web framwork for python.It is widely used for building web applications and APIs.
  Flask follows the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard. Flask is used in conjunction with a
  WSGI server (Gunicorn) to run the appoms app.
